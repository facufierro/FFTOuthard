## TrueHardcore
For NORMAL & Hardcore Modes. Improved AI, deadlier scenarios, no more cheesing fights and unique mechanics.

## WHAT EXACTLY IS DIFFERENT?-------------------------------

- **Dying** now applies stacks of Mortality (up to 3 each death), which reduces your defensive stats by 5 and can stack up to 10 times. 

- - This debuff can only be cleansed by visiting a **Cleanser** (near the inn of all cities) OR using a Trinket of Elatt.

- - - -**Trinkets of Elatt** can be bought from general merchants or crafted from 4 Beeds of Elatt.

- - - - **Beeds of Elatt** can be found randomly in any enemy, any chest, or any other kind of loot.

- **Blessings**: Blessings that strongly buff certain stats can be purchased from cleansers, but are lost on death and need to be purchased again.

- **Enemies will no longer be blind** and will spot you from further away and have better hearing. Killing an entire bandit camp one by one is no longer possible without proper stealth. **(togglable for compatibility)**

- No longer can you **cheese fights** by running forever or coming back days later, as enemies now start regenerating HP **if succesfully damaging the player**.

- **Stop enemies regeneration** by dealing direct damage to them.

- Enemies heal whenever you **change zone or die**. No cheese.

- **(new v3.1)** Base stability regen is lower and stops when blocking. Block efficiently.

- Hitting a blocking enemy slightly **damages your own stability**.

- **(new v3.1)** Mana spells consume a bit of stability too. Being an OP wizard takes a toll on your body.

- Enemies will **fight each other** more often, leading to some chaotic scenarios.

- Enemies fighting each other **dont ignore players**. They may switch targets at any time.

- **(new v3.1)** After triggering a **TRAP** enemies become aware of other traps, not triggering further contraptions for a few seconds. You can no longer fill a room with a million traps and expect everyone to die instantly.

- Dying damages your armor a lot more, and **if it breaks**, it can **ONLY** be repaired by a **blacksmith**.

- Bandits are now proper bandits. Dying by their hand will **take most (if not all) of your money**. Why would they take 30 gold and leave 2000 on you?

- **Vagrancy** is no longer allowed in cities. Buy a house or sleep in the wilds. 

- **Guarding while sleeping** is no longer a thing. Always be prepared for an ambush. **(togglable)**

- **(new v3.1)** Cities close their outer gates **at night**. Get in early, be ready to camp, OR bribe your way in. **(togglable)**

- **Reviving** fallen players takes longer. Think before you revive each other.

- **Looting in combat** is much slower, putting you in a dangerous position.  No loot n run. **(togglable ouf of combat)**

- **Per City Stashes**. Like oldward, each city has their own stash, instead of a universal one. **(togglable)**

- Some camping items like **flint, can break** on use.

- **Crafting** requires knowledge of the **recipe**. Google is not immersive. (exceptions apply, like lantern refils or special arena items OR ALL MOD ITEMSs) **(togglable)**

- **Changing gear** (except hand items) in **combat** is slower and can be extremely risky. **(togglable out of combat)**

- A certain **lever** in a certain **wind dungeon** can get stuck, stopping you from cheesing it with no effort.
