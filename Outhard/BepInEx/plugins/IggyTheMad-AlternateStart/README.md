HUMONGOUS THANKS TO SINAI & EMO FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE <3

OVERVIEW-------------------------------------------------------------

New playthroughs start in heaven, where you can choose your new start.

You can choose between 13 Backstory Scenarios, where your player will be given buffs and debuffs to spice gameplay and have a different short intro quest that lets you join a faction immediately. 
If you prefer vanilla, you can choose between 5 Vanilla-like scenarios, with no changes other than start location and skip to faction join.

(In Multiplayer, scenario is defined by host player 1, but other players can still choose their own starting perks)
